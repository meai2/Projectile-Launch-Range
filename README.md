# Projectile-Launch-Range
Python function that accepts inputs and returns the calculated range as an output using the provided starter code

For a projectile launched with a velocity v [m/s) at an angle to the horizontal θ
[rad], the horizontal distance travelled (also called the range) is given by a formula
where the altitude of the landing position is Δh higher than that of the launch position
and g is the gravitational acceleration (use 9.81 m/s^2). Note: θ in the formula is in radians.
